# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analytics Project

This repository presents a healthcare data analysis project using synthetic patient records. It focuses on exploring demographic patterns and test result distributions to simulate real-world data insights. The project showcases Excel data cleaning and Tableau dashboard creation, with planned integration of SQL queries.

This project utilizes a single synthetic dataset that includes: **Patient demographics** (age, gender, blood type), **Admission/discharge details**, **Test results** (numerical values), and **Provider and department data**. The data has been cleaned and standardized to improve accuracy and consistency for visualization and future SQL querying.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **Tableau** – Data visualization and dashboard building  
- **SQL (Coming Soon)** – For data exploration, segmentation, and KPI creation

## 🧼 Excel Cleaning Highlights

- Standardized text using `PROPER`, `TRIM`, and `CLEAN`  
- Removed prefixes like Mr., Ms., Dr. for consistency  
- Rounded numerical fields for cleaner visual output  
- Removed duplicates and normalized provider names using:  
  `=IF(K2="UnitedHealthcare", "United Healthcare", K2)`  
- Ensured consistent column types for Tableau integration

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard Features

This dashboard presents a visual summary of healthcare patterns with the following elements:

- 📌 **Pie charts** – Blood type and gender distribution  
- 📈 **Box plots** – Length of stay per test result  
- 📊 **Bar charts** – Test result trends by age and gender  
- ✅ **KPI cards** – Average test results, total patients, and more  

Dashboard screenshots are included in the repository.  
*🔗 Tableau Public link coming soon.*

## 🧮 Planned SQL Integration

A future SQL analysis section will include:

- 🧍 Patient segmentation by age, gender, and department  
- 📐 Calculation of average test results  
- 📊 KPI creation such as abnormal test rates and average length of stay  
- 🔗 Joining and aggregating healthcare tables for department-level insights  

SQL scripts will be added to `sql_analysis.sql` once completed.
